# VPN Design Clone

This project showcases a clone of a VPN design, demonstrating the use of various technologies and libraries.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Sass**: A preprocessor that extends CSS with variables, nested rules, and more.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, with three screen sizes: small (less than `640px`), medium (`768px`), and large (`1024px`).
- **Popup Timer**: A timer popup appears after 5 seconds of loading, which can be closed by clicking the button.

## Why These Technologies?

I used Tailwind CSS and Sass to demonstrate my proficiency in different CSS libraries, showcasing my ability to create responsive and modern designs. Additionally, the inclusion of TypeScript highlights my skills in building robust applications with typed JavaScript.
